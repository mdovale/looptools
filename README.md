# looptools

A Python library for modeling, analyzing, and simulating feedback control loops, with a focus on scientific and engineering applications such as laser locking, electronics, and precision instrumentation.

## ðŸ”§ What is `looptools`?

`looptools` provides an object-oriented framework for building and analyzing control loops as directed graphs of signal-processing components. It supports:

- Modular design of control systems using Python classes and NumPy/Scipy tools
- Construction of linear time-invariant (LTI) models via symbolic transfer functions or tabulated data
- Frequency-domain and time-domain simulation of system behavior
- Visualization and analysis of loop stability, gain, noise propagation, and performance
- Extensibility through subclassing and dynamic graph generation

The library is designed with scientific control systems in mindâ€”especially applications in optics, interferometry, and laser metrology.

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- **Component-based modeling**: Each system block is a `Component` with defined transfer functions, inputs, and outputs.
- **Flexible interconnection**: Loops are defined by connecting components into directed graphs, not just serial chains.
- **Simulation support**: Built-in methods to simulate step responses, noise propagation, and open/closed-loop behavior.
- **Plotting utilities**: Visualize Bode plots, noise budgets, signal flow graphs, and more.
- **Extensible**: Easily define custom blocks, auto-generate loop structures, and integrate with hardware configurations.

## ðŸ’¡ Design Philosophy

- Favor explicit, graph-based design over implicit signal paths
- Maintain clarity between loop structure and numerical simulation
- Support rapid prototyping of complex control systems
- Blend symbolic (transfer function) and numeric (data-driven) components
