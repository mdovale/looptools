# looptools

A Python library for modeling, analyzing, and simulating feedback control loops, with a focus on scientific and engineering applications such as laser locking, electronics, and precision instrumentation.

## ðŸ”§ What is `looptools`?

`looptools` provides an object-oriented framework for building and analyzing control loops as directed graphs of signal-processing components. It supports:

- Modular design of control systems using Python classes and NumPy/Scipy tools
- Construction of linear time-invariant (LTI) models via symbolic transfer functions or tabulated data
- Frequency-domain and time-domain simulation of system behavior
- Visualization and analysis of loop stability, gain, noise propagation, and performance
- Extensibility through subclassing and dynamic graph generation

The library is designed with scientific control systems in mindâ€”especially applications in optics, interferometry, and laser metrology.

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- **Component-based modeling**: Each system block is a `Component` with defined transfer functions, inputs, and outputs.
- **Flexible interconnection**: Loops are defined by connecting components into directed graphs, not just serial chains.
- **Simulation support**: Built-in methods to simulate step responses, noise propagation, and open/closed-loop behavior.
- **Plotting utilities**: Visualize Bode plots, noise budgets, signal flow graphs, and more.
- **Extensible**: Easily define custom blocks, auto-generate loop structures, and integrate with hardware configurations.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from looptools.component import Component
from looptools.components import PIIControllerComponent
from looptools.loop import LOOP
import looptools.loopmath as lm

# Define loop parameters
sps = 80e6  # Loop update frequency in Hz
frfr = np.logspace(np.log10(1e0), np.log10(40e6), int(1e5))[:-1]  # Frequency array (Hz)

# Define Plant using Laplace-domain string (auto-discretized)
w_n = 2 * np.pi * 10e3 # 10 kHz resonance
zeta = 0.05 # damping ratio
plant = Component("Plant", sps=sps, tf=f"{w_n**2} / (s**2 + {2*zeta*w_n}*s + {w_n**2})", domain='s')

# Define Sensor using z-domain string (explicit difference equation)
sensor = Component("Sensor", sps=sps, tf="(0.391 + 0.391*z**-1) / (1 - 0.218*z**-1)", domain='z')

# Compute the P-servo log2 gain from a dB value
p_log2_gain = lm.db_to_log2_gain(80)

# Compute the integrator log2 gains for a certain cross-over frequency with the P-servo
i_log2_gain, ii_log2_gain = lm.gain_for_crossover_frequency(p_log2_gain, sps, (1e4, 1e1), kind='II')

# Define PI controller component with those gains
controller = PIIControllerComponent("Controller", sps=sps, Kp=p_log2_gain, Ki=i_log2_gain, Kii=ii_log2_gain)

# Build the loop
loop = LOOP(sps, [plant, sensor, controller], name="My Loop")

# Visualize block diagram
loop.block_diagram(dpi=200)

# Bode plot of open-loop gain
fig, ax = loop.bode_plot(frfr)
plt.show()

# Nyquist plot of open-loop gain
fig, ax = loop.nyquist_plot(frfr, which='G', logy=True, logx=True, critical_point=True)
plt.show()
```
